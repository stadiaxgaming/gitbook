# GamePass/EventPass Play to Earn

A user who has minted an EventPass automatically earns an allocation of StadiaX (STADX) Tokens large enough for "X" attempts at setting a qualifying high score to progress to the next round. For example, each gameplay may cost 50 STADX to play and an EventPass may come with 150 STADX. Most games will go for 3 rounds, with the top 10% of scoring players advancing from round to round. The user pays 50 STADX to play the game and sets a high score on their first try. They have the option to save this score to their EventPass or discard it. Because saving a score to an EventPass (on a blockchain) costs ETH gas, this is an operation the user must choose to do based on the score and if it qualifies, etc.

After achieving a qualifying high score, the user waits for the round to end. If their EventPass is knocked out of the top 10% they will receive a notification through EPNS and email. If knocked out, the user has the chance to pay to play again within the current round and attempt to set a higher score, etc.

In this case, the first score set is not beaten, and the user advances to round 2. Upon advancing, the user gets another 3 free gameplays of StadiaX (+150 STADX) and the process of setting a high score and maintaining a top 10% position repeats. Round 2 introduces more challenging game mechanics.&#x20;

The user survives round 2 and advances to the final round, round 3. Round 3 introduces the most challenging game mechanics and a fresh 3 free plays of the game (+150 STADX). During any of the rounds, the user has the option to vote to end the game early. If 75%+ of qualifying active users vote to end the game early, the game ends, and the prize is distributed to all remaining players equally. In this example, the users decide to play the game out to the end. In this case, the user in the #1 position at the close of round 3 wins the prize. Because the user was in the #1 position, the 10E locked in the contract is paid out to the wallet address owning the EventPass with the highest score, and the game concludes.

The EventPasses from previous Game Events can still be held and used for increased rewards from reward holding.

**Proof of Prize**

Every game deployed on StadiaX has a corresponding smart contract for managing the related asset distribution functions in a decentralized manner. Game prize pools on StadiaX are powered by a technology called Proof of Prize, whereby assets that are held as prizes for the winners of game contests can always be publicly verified on the blockchain. This is done through the deployment of a smart contract, which acts as a custodian for the game’s prize pool. This pool of assets is guaranteed to be paid out to the winners of the game based on the score data embedded on the blockchain within their GamePass/EventPass. There is an emergency multisig withdrawal mechanism to enable platform operators to withdraw funds in the case of error or other critical situations.\

**Proof of Payout**

A complementary technology to Proof of Prize, Proof of Payout provides all users with publicly verifiable blockchain evidence that a game’s prize pool has been paid out to contest winners, in accordance with the rules applicable to the related game. Payouts are triggered by any public blockchain user calling the doPayout() function after the contest period for that game’s payout cycle has ended - typically at the end of every month for GamePasses and after the game tournament has ended for EventPasses.

When the doPayout() function is called on the smart contract backing a specific game, after the game contest has ended, the function will:

1. Reference the GamePass/EventPass token collection related to the game deployment.
2. Identify the token containing the winning score(s) based on the game’s payout configuration, and in turn, identify the wallet that owns those winning GamePass/EventPass NFT tokens.
3. Initiate a series of transactions on the blockchain distributing the prize pool being held in custody through Proof of Prize to the winning wallets in accordance with the payout configuration for that game (ie: 100% of the pool to 1st place, or 70% to 1st, 30% to 2nd, 20% to third, etc.).

The blockchain evidence of payout generated by the execution of step 3 of this process constitutes the technology known as Proof of Payout.
