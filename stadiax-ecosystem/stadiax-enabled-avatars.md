# StadiaX Enabled Avatars

Participating StadiaX Games may allow players to use an Avatar contained in NFTs in their wallets as their in-game Avatar. The StadiaX platform will allow the Game Developers to designate which avatars from which partner collections are supported by the game and can be used by players. The StadiaX SDK will provide the functions and services needed to manage, edit, and utilize Avatars in-game. In-game representation of the NFT Avatars may vary as required by the game performance requirements.

These Avatars may also be included with specific GamePasses for the corresponding game or  other partner games supporting their utilization. This will entice players to collect or trade GamePasses featuring highly desired Avatars across the gaming platform.

Specific StadiaX NFT Avatars and game assets may be featured items in the StadiaX reward catalog.

Game Developers and NFT Avatar creators may collaborate to promote and feature the benefits of each and the value to the players.
