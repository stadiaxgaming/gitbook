# Rewards Catalog

A user who has accumulated STADX tokens from drops, loyalty programs, GamePass or EventPass rewards can use those tokens to buy featured NFT from the StadiaX rewards catalog.

The rewards catalog will allow the StadiaX platform to list NFTs that can be purchased (redeemed) for STADX (static price and not an auction format). These reward items will provide an incentive for users to earn STADX and spend them on these items in the catalog, which will support the STADX circulating ecosystem. The catalog will be seeded with selected partner collection NFTs/Tokens (donated or traded) and StadiaX NFTs (reserved GamePasses and Membership) along with select prime third-party NFTs to attract new StadiaX users. All items in the STADX rewards catalog are listed in STADX and require ETH only to pay for the gas of the transaction.

The STADX “spent” for these catalog rewards will be returned to StadiaX to be used or redistributed to platform activities such as promotions, loyalty programs, Game prizes, and other platform-benefiting activities, thereby creating a healthy circulating system based on STADX as the native token powering the economy.
