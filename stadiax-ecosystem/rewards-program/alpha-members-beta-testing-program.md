# Alpha Members - Beta Testing Program

Alpha Membership holders have the exclusive right to receive rewards by beta testing games. For each game that an Alpha Membership holder beta tests and reviews, they earn a proportional share of the beta testing reward allocation for that game determined by future private and public sales of GamePasses of that game. By contributing to beta testing activities, Alpha users share in StadiaX revenue.
