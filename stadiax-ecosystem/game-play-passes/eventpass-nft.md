# EventPass NFT

**StadiaX EventPass NFT (tournament specific)** - NFT token that holds a userâ€™s score and participation/elimination/final rank status for a specific Game Event of a specific game. To participate in a game, a user needs an EventPass for that specific Game Event. The score data within the NFT is used to calculate the round leaderboards, who will advance or be eliminated, and the final ranking at the end of the Game Event for prize distribution.

The revenue from minting EventPasses is allocated to the designated Prize Pool Structure for the Game Event. A portion of that pool is distributed to the game developers (in-house or external) to foster more game development and improvement for future Game Events. The bulk of the prize pool (according to the specific Prize Pool Structure) plus any seed prize (sponsored by StadiaX and/or the Game Developer) is to be won according to the final outcome of the whole Game Event.

The Event Structure determines the maximum number of EventPasses that will be minted (and potentially utilized) and the structure of advancement and elimination from each round according to the performance of each EventPass holder for each round for each Game Event. A holder using two EventPasses acts as two players and cannot pool scores or performance across EventPasses.

The EventPass NFT will automatically issue the holder a certain amount of STADX tokens at the beginning of each Event Round (which amounts would change over time as the project roadmap develops), which may be spent on gameplay in a round of a Game Event.

The STADX tokens utilized for each gameplay additionally contribute in a designated ratio to the prize pool total as the event rounds progress. The longer the Game Event lasts, the larger the pool of STADX tokens available to be won.

EventPass prize pools are governed by smart contracts in the same way as GamePass prize pools. Creating the same transparency and auditability for EventPasses as exists for GamePasses.

Between rounds of the Game Event, the EventPass holders may sell their EventPass to trade their position in the event to another user. The new purchaser can continue through the Game Event as if they were the original holder.
