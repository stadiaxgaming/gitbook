# GamePass/EventPass Resale

As a user who has minted an EventPass and is very skilled at the specific game that is tied to the EventPass, can ‘flip’ their EventPass NFTs to users of lesser skill. A skilled user could buy cheap EventPass NFTs on the marketplace for floor value, set a prize-qualifying high score on the EventPass, and then re-list it for sale on an NFT marketplace. Users who are not able to set qualifying scores can then purchase these EventPasses to stay in the running for the Play to Earn prize related to the game.

The standing of a player in any current game tournament is attached to the corresponding EventPass, and so tournament standing can be traded and/or sold.
