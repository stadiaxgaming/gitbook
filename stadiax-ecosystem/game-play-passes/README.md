# Game Play Passes

The StadiaX platform offers two distinct types of gameplay passes, each designed to cater to different gaming preferences and styles: GamePasses and EventPasses.

**GamePasses** provide players with lifetime access to their chosen game, ensuring endless entertainment and engagement. One of the key features of these passes is the opportunity to win prizes at the end of each season, adding a competitive edge to the gaming experience. To keep the games fresh and exciting, StadiaX updates them every season, which also serves to reset scores, thus maintaining a level playing field and keeping the competition spirited. There is no limit to the quantity of GamePasses, allowing unlimited access for players who wish to join any time.

**EventPasses**, on the other hand, are tailored for those who thrive in high-stakes, competitive environments. These passes grant exclusive access to limited-period, elimination-style tournaments that are often special versions of the games available on StadiaX. These events are designed to be more intense and challenging, culminating in large prizes awarded at the end of the event. EventPasses cater to players looking for a more dynamic and competitive gaming experience, with the thrill of potentially significant rewards.

Both types of passes are integral to the StadiaX ecosystem, offering diverse ways for players to engage, compete, and be rewarded. While GamePasses offer a more enduring and evolving gameplay experience, EventPasses provide a platform for high-energy, short-term competitions with substantial rewards, ensuring that StadiaX caters to a wide range of gaming preferences and styles.
