# GamePass NFT

**StadiaX GamePass NFT (game-specific)** - NFT token that registers a userâ€™s scores and free play allocations for a specific Open Game. The score data within the NFT is used to calculate leaderboards during and at the end of the game seasons/periods. The free play allocation of the GamePass allows the user to play a certain amount of free gameplays (i.e. not requiring the user to spend STADX tokens) within a recurring period, which amounts would change over time as the project roadmap develops.

The Open Game (GamePass) version and Game Event (EventPass) version of the same game are different enough such that users can not gain an overwhelming advantage by grinding skill advancement in Open Games to win in Event Game counterparts.

A designated portion of revenue from minting GamePasses is distributed to the game developers (in-house or external) to foster game development and improvement.

GamePass NFTs can be resold in marketplaces. They allow the purchaser to take over and continue to play as the original holder receiving free plays, and advancing or reducing their GamePass Ranking.

Alpha and Beta Membership holders receive **one** free GamePass (pre-public sale) for all new Open Games added to the platform. They can resell that GamePass but must buy a replacement if they want to access GamePass perks and privileges. Holders of Gamma Membership can purchase one discounted GamePass (pre-public sale) for all new Open Games added to the platform. This allows membership holders to act as early access beta testers and reviewers of games before GamePasses are available to other users (non-members) during the public sale.

Non-membership-holding users and/or holders having consumed the free or discount allocation can purchase GamePasses (during the public sale) for all new Open Games added to the platform and approved for public sale.

Prizes (as designated by the StadiaX platform) will be awarded periodically to GamePass holders for ranking performance in Open Games, as an additional incentive to users to play games. Prizes may be seeded to promote them (on public launch or as a special promotion).

Prize pools are governed by smart contracts enabling transparency around the amount to be earned and the proof that rewards have been paid out to winners. Because GamePasses act as proxies for user scores, the entire payout process can be fully audited by third parties using blockchain data to validate that the prize pool has been paid out as publicly communicated.

The STADX tokens utilized for game plays additionally contribute (in a designated ratio) to the prize pool total of a designated period. Free gameplays from GamePass holders do not contribute STADX tokens (since STADX tokens are not spent for these pass holders) to the period prize pool for that game.
