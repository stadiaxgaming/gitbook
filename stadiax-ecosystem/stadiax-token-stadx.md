# StadiaX Token (STADX)

As the native platform currency, players can utilize STADX tokens to play the games (without using a GamePass) by paying a certain amount of STADX tokens, which amounts would change over time as the project roadmap develops. In this regard, EventPasses would provide holders with a certain amount of STADX tokens at the beginning of each round, for them to participate in gameplay (see EventPasses below).

Users can purchase and use STADX Tokens for Open Games and additional gameplays in Event Game Rounds, based on their specific requirements. STADX is fungible and transferrable, so unused STADX tokens may be stored and/or utilized as the user sees fit - resold in marketplaces, used in Open Games, the rewards store, DAO voting, or withdrawn from the platform for other use cases. Based on prevailing market conditions, the StadiaX platform aims to target a specific fiat price-per-play within Open and Event-based games, in order to ensure that the per-play cost is comparable to the prizes at stake within any specific game being played.

As a network effect, users may keep their STADX in their wallet and utilize it for spending with any third-party game, merchant, or provider unrelated to the platform that is willing to accept these STADX on their platform or for settlement of transactions
