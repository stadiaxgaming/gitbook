# Platform DAO Governance

Users who purchase either an Alpha or Beta Membership will have the opportunity to participate in DAO-like governance activities related to the platformâ€™s existing and future feature set.

The governance mechanism will involve different categories for voting on governance proposals, and certain categories of proposals may require holders of Alpha or Beta Membership to hold a certain amount of STADX Tokens to be able to participate in voting.

Users who participate in governance have the ability to publicly propose new features and vote on existing proposals. Proposals that receive the most votes, combined with input from the StadiaX Project Contributors may be promoted to official features and incorporated into the platform's roadmap. Similarly, governance can be used to suggest partnerships, marketing activities, or other actions that ultimately serve to enhance the value created for members and platform participants.
