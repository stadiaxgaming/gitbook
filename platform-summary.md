# The Details

StadiaX is a web3 gaming platform that provides users with a new and unique way of engaging with gaming experiences as a whole. At its core, StadiaX allows users to access a variety of Games and time-limited/tournament-style events in which they can play and compete in to earn rankings and rewards. Open Games (available to non-members) can be played at any time, by anyone, with a corresponding GamePass or sufficient STADX tokens. Whereas each Game Event runs during a prescribed period, for a limited number of participants, and requires a corresponding EventPass to participate. Participants have a chance at winning the prize available from that Game Event. Prizes can be cryptocurrency tokens, NFTs, or other web3 content.

StadiaX provides game developers with a platform and ecosystem to publish, review, promote, and monetize (without ads) browser-compatible games to an active community of gaming and crypto enthusiasts. Game developers can withdraw, hold, or redeploy their game proceeds to improve their offering or develop new games or Game Event formats for the platform. Furthermore, game developers can harness this value without any pre-existing knowledge of blockchain systems or web3 technologies. The StadiaX organization will provide APIs and SDKs that fully abstract the complexity of blockchain integration away from the game developer, allowing them to focus on the gaming experience and creating valuable and engaging experiences for end users. StadiaX will also assist the external game developers with financial support and resources to publish and grow their game offerings and proceeds. As the ecosystem grows, the game developers' earnings should increase, enabling more opportunities.

The ways in which users access games make the platform even more motivating and unique for players and game developers. Players can utilize STADX tokens to play Open Games ad hoc or purchase GamePasses to play games more economically. Members can purchase EventPasses to participate in tournament-style versions of games structured to prevent abuse and ensure fair play while providing the opportunity for players to win prize pools of STADX tokens and other Crypto rewards based on their performance. Users purchasing Memberships can participate in Open Games for free or at a discounted rate depending on the membership level. Members also have access to exclusive loyalty and platform participation rewards. Any user can buy or sell STADX tokens, GamePasses, EventPasses or Memberships they acquire on third-party marketplaces based on their requirements. STADX tokens, Memberships, GamePasses, and EventPasses can all be resold by players or game developers.

Users can acquire additional STADX tokens through minting and “reward holding” a StadiaX membership NFT along with one or more GamePass or EventPass NFTs or other StadiaX-mint-enable NFTs as determined by the StadiaX Project Contributors or community. Users who participate in loyalty rewards programs with their StadiaX membership will earn STADX tokens on a daily basis, and these can be used for additional gameplays or other STADX token-enabled web3 experiences on third-party platforms.
