# Background

While early adopters have shown enthusiasm for blockchain-specific games, a significant shift is underway in the mainstream market, particularly among highly engaged players who are pivotal in driving game adoption and virality. This shift is notably towards NFT-powered games and play-to-earn models, features central to the StadiaX gaming experience. These types of games resonate strongly with the 18-35 demographic, a consumer-driven group keen on investing in virtual identities and accumulating unique collections of digital assets. StadiaX taps into this trend by offering players the opportunity to own, trade, and leverage in-game assets, such as NFTs and tokens, which are not only valuable within the game but also in the broader digital economy.
